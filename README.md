Just testing the Spigot API in Java, adding some wanted features to my Minecraft server

##### Features
- AutoFish (For lazy people who doesn't want to fish, with a cooldown of 20 minutes)
- giveSand (Just gives a stack of sand, plain simple)
- SleepCommand (Skips to daytime if its night)
- mobLootDeathHandler (Unwanted loot from mobs will not drop such as Ender Pearls, Rotten Flesh, Saddles etc. [_will be configurable in the future!_])
- richCheck (Checks if player has more than a certain amount of diamonds on login, if amount is under threshold it says you're poor)
